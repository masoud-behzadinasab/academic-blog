## **Computational and Data Science and Engineering Mentorship (CDSEM)**

In a period of progressive movements for social equality for all groups of people including black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC), women, and the LGBTQ community, among others, it is important that the academic world plays its role in promoting civil rights. Increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion not only pertains to gender and race, but also encompasses socioeconomic status, disability, sexual identity, religion, age, and intersections therein. 

To contribute to addressing this issue, and inspired by similar initiatives by fellow academics, I would like to launch the **Computational and Data Science and Engineering Mentorship (CDSEM) program**. Annually, I will offer support to two **high school or college students from underrepresented communities** who wish to pursue a career in **Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)**. The mentorship will be provided for each mentee up to three years, in which they will build their self-confidence and understanding, learn how to define clear goals, and eventually, shape a proper portfolio and prepare for an impactful journey in STEM fields.

If you are eligible and interested in the program, please apply before November 30, 2021 with:
1. 1- or 2-page statement describing your interests within computational science and engineering, data science and engineering, and/or applied mathematics and how you wish to contribute to STEM
2. CV

Send all the materials as a single PDF file to Dr. Masoud Behzadinasab: masoud_behzadinasab@brown.edu
