I am a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Engineering at Brown University (postdoc advisor: <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/ybazilev">Prof. Yuri Bazilevs</a>). I joined Brown in January 2020 after finishing my Ph.D. in Engineering Mechanics at The University of Texas at Austin (PhD advisor: <a href="https://www.pge.utexas.edu/facultystaff/faculty-directory/foster">Prof. John Foster</a>). Prior to PhD, I received my BSc degree in Mechanical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Iran, in 2013, and my MSE degree in Mechanical Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin in 2015.

My research interests include **computational mechanics, fracture mechanics, fluid-structure interaction, data-driven mechanics, and machine learning**. My research involves developing accurate, efficient, and robust predictive models for simulating the behavior of different materials, solid structures, and fluid flows in extreme conditions involving large deformation, fracture, and fragmentation (e.g. blast events). My eventual goal is oriented towards **building a computational platform for the design of resilient and smart materials, structures, and vehicles**. In doing so, I consider the best of different numerical techniques as the ingredients of my computational framework, i.e., **a combination of robust physics-based simulations with artificial intelligence**. I use and develop meshfree methods (e.g. peridynamics), finite element and isogeometric analyses, and data-driven tools (e.g. Neural Networks) to tackle a wide range of engineering problems (see the {{< staticref "research" >}}Research{{< /staticref >}} tab for more details and the {{< staticref "publication" >}}Publication{{< /staticref >}} tab for a complete list of my papers).
